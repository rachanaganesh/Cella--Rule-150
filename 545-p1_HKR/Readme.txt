Class number:545 Software Architecture

Project number and name:Project #1 - Cella Rule 150

Team name and members:HKR, Heena Pallan,Kamakshi Chaudhry,Rachana Ganesh

Intro (including the algorithm used): This project is designed to display the progress of Wolfram's Rule-150 cellular automaton. This rule specifies the next color in the cell, based on its color and its immediate neighbors.

Algorithm:
	1.Define a 2D array of 400 by 400
	2.Assigned all the cells values to 0
	3.Assigned cell[0][190]=1
	4.Passing the new array cells value
	5.Gives valtue to cells determing the values of previous row by checking the cella 		rule 150
	6.Passing the stored  cells values to generate the coloured grid
	7.Fill the color in the grid based on cells values(0 or 1)

Contents: draw-stuff.js,style.css,js-1.html

External Requirements: Web browser is required to run HTML file

Setup and Installation: Extract the 545-p1-HKR.zip and copy that folder on desktop.Run the js-1.html file from the folder on browser.

Features: 400 by 400 square grid is used.Further more Wolfram's Rule-150 cellular automaton rule is implemented

Bugs: No bugs, but project running little slow due to large array size(400 by 400)
